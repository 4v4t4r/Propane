An Open Source KoTH Platform based on [NetKotH](https://github.com/NetKotH/netkoth-python)

Currently very much a WIP!

Watch this project progress, but we strongly reccommend using NetKotH until we've rolled out a release!


# TODO:
1. Document base code, and write user instructions
2. Create "official" logo
3. Create white/black list feature
4. Create timed event feature
5. Setup/Install Scripts
6. INITIAL RELEASE ??????? (MAYBE)
7. TBD...Whatever else we come up with
