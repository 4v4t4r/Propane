<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InjectionSoftwareDevelopment/Propane/master/temp_logo.png" width=250px height=350px/>



An Open Source KoTH Platform based on [NetKotH](https://github.com/NetKotH/netkoth-python)

Currently very much a WIP!

Watch this project progress, but we strongly reccommend using NetKotH until we've rolled out a release!


# How to use Propane (temporary guide):
1. Start up your favorite web server.
2. Put Propane somewhere where it can write to the INDEX of the web server.
3. Edit the [propane_config.ini](https://github.com/InjectionSoftwareDevelopment/Propane/blob/master/doc/markdown/propane_config.md) to write to the correct web directory.
4. Specify TARGETS in the propane_config.ini
5. Run `python propane.py`
6. ???
7. $$$

(We will expound on the instructions further as documentation rolls out. The process will get simpler as we near a release build)


# TODO:
1. Document base code, and write user instructions
2. Create "official" logo
3. Create white/black list feature
4. Create timed event feature
5. Setup/Install Scripts
6. INITIAL RELEASE ??????? (MAYBE)
7. TBD...Whatever else we come up with
